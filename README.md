#MoviepilotEntertain

A JavaScript (user script) for searching the Telekom Entertain EPG from the IMDB-a-like Moviepilot.de web site.

##Introduction

A user script is a little piece of Java Script that a web browser provides to alter the content of websites on the client side.


##Example

Once installed as a user script, the script adds a link called 'Entertain' to each movie listed on Moviepilot.de.

![Moviepilot web site](res/moviepilot.png?raw=true "Moviepilot web site")

By clicking on the link, a new browser window opens with a search for the movie on the Telekom Entertain website. From here you're free to chose which of the resulting schedules you want to record.

Please install Greasemonkey from https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ as a browser plugin.

You have to enable the Developer's mode in the extensions settings (top of the site). After you've downloaded this user script, drag and drop it to the extensions settings window as shown below.

### Safari
I don't know of a working user script plugin for Safari. There has been Greasekit but it was abandoned in the past and isn't working anymore.

### Internet Explorer
Well it's the Internet Explorer.
